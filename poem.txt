Title: Whispers of the Ancient Forest

In a realm where whispers waltz on zephyrs,
Lies an ancient forest, veiled in mystery,
With trees that talk in silent verses,
And brooks that murmur tales of history.

The verdant leaves, a canopy so dense,
Guard secrets of the days of yore,
Every dawn brings a quiet suspense,
Of tales untold and lore of lore.

The morning sun with tender rays,
Peeks through the foliage in soft caress,
Kissing the dew on leafy sprays,
A golden touch in gentle press.

Amid the trees, a clearing lies,
Where flowers dance in colors bold,
Their petals whisper soft goodbyes,
To night's dark reign and moon's hold cold.

The creatures of the woodland stir,
As daylight weaves through shadows long,
The squirrel scurries, the songbirds purr,
The forest wakes to morningâ€™s song.

The ancient oaks with bark so rough,
Stand guard over secrets deep,
Their leaves rustle tales of love,
And ancient feuds that never sleep.

By the brook, the willows weep,
Their tears are whispers in the breeze,
Tales of joy and sorrows steep,
Echo through the silent trees.

As evening descends with tranquil grace,
And casts a silvery, soft glow,
The forest wears a dreamy face,
As stars above begin to show.

In the heart of night, the forest dreams,
Of yesteryears and days to come,
In the silence, every starbeam gleams,
On the tranquil, ancient, woodland home.

And so the cycle spins anew,
With each dawn, the stories grow,
The ancient forest, with shades so true,
Keeps time with whispers soft and low.

In each leaf, a story spins,
In every breeze, a tale takes flight,
Thus, the ancient woodland brims,
With endless tales from dawn to night.
